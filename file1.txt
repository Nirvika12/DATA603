Dobby was here in Privet Drive? Could Dobby be
following him right at this very moment? As this
thought occurred he wheeled around and stared back
down Privet Drive, but it appeared to be completely
deserted again and Harry was sure that Dobby did
not know how to become invisible...
He walked on, hardly aware of the route he was
taking, for he had pounded these streets so often
lately that his feet carried him to his favorite haunts
automatically
. Every few steps he glanced back over

his shoulder
. Someone magical had been near him as
he lay among Aunt Petunias dying begonias, he was
sure of it. Why hadn’
t they spoken to him, why hadn’
t
they made contact, why were they hiding now?
And then, as his feeling of frustration peaked, his
certainty leaked away
.
Perhaps it hadn’
t been a magical sound after all.
Perhaps he was so desperate for the tiniest sign of
contact from the world to which he belonged that he

was simply overreacting to perfectly ordinary noises.
Could he be 
sur
e
 it hadn’
t been the sound of
something breaking inside a neighbor
’
s house?
Harry felt a dull, sinking sensation in his stomach
and, before he knew it, the feeling of hopelessness
that had plagued him all summer rolled over him
once again...
T
omorrow morning he would be awoken by the alarm
at five o’clock so that he could pay the owl that
delivered the 
Daily Pr
ophet
 — but was there any point
in continuing to take it? Harry merely glanced at the
front page before throwing it aside these days; when
the idiots who ran the paper finally realized that
V
oldemort was back it would be headline news, and
that was the only kind Harry cared about.
If he was lucky
, there would also be owls carrying
letters from his best friends, Ron and Hermione,
though any expectation he had had that their letters
would bring him news had long since been dashed.

amount going on, we’ll tell you everything when we see
 
you
...”
But when were they going to see him? Nobody seemed
too bothered with a precise date. Hermione had
scribbled, 
“I expect we’ll be seeing you quite soon
”
inside his birthday card, but how soon was soon? As
far as Harry could tell from the vague hints in their
letters, Hermione and Ron were in the same place,
presumably at Ron’
s parents’ house. He could hardly
bear to think of the pair of them having fun at the
Burrow when he was stuck in Privet Drive. In fact, he
was so angry at them that he had thrown both their
birthday presents of Honeydukes chocolates away
unopened, though he had regretted this after eating
the wilting salad Aunt Petunia had provided for
dinner that night.
And what were Ron and Hermione busy with? Why

wasn’
t he, Harry
, busy? Hadn’
t he proved himself
capable of handling much more than they? Had they
all for

 who
had entered that graveyard and watched Cedric being
murdered and been tied to that tombstone and nearly
killed … ?
Don’
t think about that, 
Harry told himself sternly for
the hundredth time that summer
. It was bad enough
that he kept revisiting the graveyard in his
nightmares, without dwelling on it in his waking
moments too.
He turned a corner into Magnolia Crescent; halfway
along he passed the narrow alleyway down the side of
a garage where he had first clapped eyes on his
godfather
. Sirius, at least, seemed to understand how
Harry was feeling; admittedly his letters were just as
empty of proper news as Ron and Hermione’
s, but at

least they contained words of caution and consolation
instead of tantalizing hints:

W
ell, thought Harry
, as he crossed Magnolia
Crescent, turned into Magnolia Road, and headed
toward the darkening play park, he had (by and lar
ge)
done as Sirius advised; he had at least resisted the
temptation to tie his trunk to his broomstick and set
of
f for the Burrow by himself. In fact Harry thought
his behavior had been very good considering how
frustrated and angry he felt at being stuck in Privet
Drive this long, reduced to hiding in flower beds in
the hope of hearing something that might point to
what Lord V
oldemort was doing. Nevertheless, it was
quite galling to be told not to be rash by a man who
had served twelve years in the wizard prison,
Azkaban, escaped, attempted to commit the murder
he had been convicted for in the first place, then gone
on the run with a stolen hippogrif
f...
Harry vaulted over the locked park gate and set of
f
www.ztcprep.com

across the parched grass. The park was as empty as
the surrounding streets. When he reached the swings
he sank onto the only one that Dudley and his friends
had not yet managed to break, coiled one arm around
the chain, and stared moodily at the ground. He
would not be able to hide in the Dursleys’ flower bed
again. T
omorrow he would have to think of some
fresh way of listening to the news. In the meantime,
he had nothing to look forward to but another
restless, disturbed night, because even when he
escaped nightmares about Cedric he had unsettling
dreams about long dark corridors, all finishing in
dead ends and locked doors, which he supposed had
something to do with the trapped feeling he had when
P a g e

he was awake. Often the old scar on his forehead
prickled uncomfortably
, but he did not fool himself
that Ron or Hermione or Sirius would find that very
interesting anymore... In the past his scar hurting
had warned that V
oldemort was getting stronger
www.ztcprep.com

again, but now that V
oldemort was back they would
probably remind him that its regular irritation was
only to be expected... Nothing to worry about … old
news …
The injustice of it all welled up inside him so that he
wanted to yell with fury
. If it hadn’
t been for him,
nobody would even have known V
oldemort was back!
And his reward was to be stuck in Little Whinging for
four solid weeks, completely cut of
f from the magical
world, reduced to squatting among dying begonias so
that he could hear about water
-skiing budgerigars!
How could Dumbledore have for
gotten him so easily?
Why had Ron and Hermione got together without
inviting him along too? How much longer was he
supposed to endure Sirius telling him to sit tight and
be a good boy; or resist the temptation to write to the
stupid 
Daily Pr
ophet
 and point out that V
oldemort
had returned? These furious thoughts whirled around
in Harry’
s head, and his insides writhed with anger as
a sultry
, velvety night fell around him, the air full of
www.ztcprep.com

the smell of warm, dry grass and the only sound that
of the low grumble of traf
fic on the road beyond the
park railings.
He did not know how long he had sat on the swing
before the sound of voices interrupted his musings
and he looked up. The street-lamps from the
surrounding roads were casting a misty glow strong
enough to silhouette a group of people making their
way across the park. One of them was singing a loud,
crude song. The others were laughing. A soft ticking
noise came from several expensive racing bikes that
they were wheeling along.

Harry knew who those people were. The figure in front
was unmistakably his cousin, Dudley Dursley
,
wending his way home, accompanied by his faithful
gang.
Dudley was as vast as ever
, but a year
’
s hard dieting
and the discovery of a new talent had wrought quite a
change in his physique. As Uncle V
ernon delightedly
www.ztcprep.com

told anyone who would listen, Dudley had recently
become the Junior Heavyweight Inter
-School Boxing
Champion of the Southeast. “The noble sport,” as
Uncle V
ernon called it, had made Dudley even more
formidable than he had seemed to Harry in the
primary school days when he had served as Dudley’
s
first punching bag. Harry was not remotely afraid of
his cousin anymore but he still didn’
t think that
Dudley learning to punch harder and more accurately
was cause for celebration. Neighborhood children all
around were terrified of him — even more terrified
than they were of “that Potter boy
,” who, they had
been warned, was a hardened hooligan who attended
St. Brutus’
s Secure Center for Incurably Criminal
Boys.
Harry watched the dark figures crossing the grass
and wondered whom they had been beating up
tonight. 
Look r
ound, 
Harry found himself thinking as
he watched them. 
Come on … look r
ound
 
… I’m sitting
her
e all alone... Come and have ago...

If Dudley’
s friends saw him sitting here, they would
be sure to make a beeline for him, and what would
Dudley do then? He wouldn’
t want to lose face in
front of the gang, but he’d be terrified of provoking
Harry
... It would be really fun to watch Dudley’
s
dilemma; to taunt him, watch him, with him
powerless to respond … and if any of the others tried
hitting Harry
, Harry was ready — he had his wand …
let them try … He’d love to vent some of his
P a g e

frustration on the boys who had once made his life
hell —
But they did not turn around, they did not see him,
they were almost at the railings. Harry mastered the
impulse to call after them... Seeking a fight was not a
smart move... He must not use magic... He would be
risking expulsion again...
Dudley’
s gang’
s voices died; they were out of sight,
heading along Magnolia Road.
